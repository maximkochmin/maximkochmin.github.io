        <h1>“lfopod” Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
        I operate mobile game “lfopod” (the App). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information I receive from users of the App.
        </p>

        <p>
        I use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Information Collection And Use
        </h2>

        <p>
        While using the App, I may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name ("Personal Information").
        </p>

        <h2>
            Log Data
        </h2>

        <p>
        Like many app developers, I collect information that your device sends whenever you use the App ("Log Data").
        </p>

        <p>
        This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device type, iOS version, the screens of the App that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those screens and other statistics.
        </p>

        <p>
        In addition, I may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this data to improve user interface and overall experience.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Game Center
        </h2>

        <p>
        To add competitive part for the game experience I send user's scores to Apple Game Center and place them on leadersboard for each level.
        So everyone logged in to Game Center can see what are the scores of other players. You can access leaderboards in the App by tapping on leaderboard
        button in the top right corner with a silhouette of a goblet. If you don't want to share your scores with Game Center, than you should log out of it
        in the phone/tablet settings.
        </p>
